Need to fix:
JPS Lag

Fixed:
Position on waitlist
Course name needs to be unique
Bachelor/MS duplicates
Enrolled primary key (sid, section_id)

notes
-dont need dept for other dept thesis
-need to connect dept and degree, dept offers degree
Meeting same day same building?
Faculty ( same name, but diff occupation)
Degree unique (concentration,degree type)?
